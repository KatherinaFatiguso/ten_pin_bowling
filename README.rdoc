"Ten Pin Bowling Score"

Write a ruby application that takes a string of space seperated numbers from 0 to 10
and calculates what that would be as a score in ten pin bowling.

If a final score cannot be determined from the input then method should return the
"current" score (i.e. assumes any remaining bowls score 0).

Please include instruction on how to run the application.
